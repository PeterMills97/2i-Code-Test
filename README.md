# 2i-Code-Test
This repository contains a python file answering the question: 
“In a language of your choice, using all best practice principles you’re aware of, could you please provide code that iterates in multiples of A until X, 
then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. Please state any assumptions you’ve made." 
My answer is a fucntion, with arguments A,X that when called itterates through the values specified, printing the said values. 
I assumed that the arguments of the function are integers and I used an if statment to check this condition to prevent errors.
